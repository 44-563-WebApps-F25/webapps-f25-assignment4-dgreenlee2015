        <p>
            TESS.          After sailing to this island—
            <br>
            GIA.                Tossing in a manner frightful,
            <br>
            TESS.          We are all once more on dry land—
            <br>
            GIA.                And we find the change delightful,
            <br>
            TESS.          As at home we've been remaining—
            <br>
                      We've not seen you both for ages,
            <br>
            GIA.           Tell me, are you fond of reigning?—
            <br>
                      How's the food, and what's the wages?
            <br>
            TESS.          Does your new employment please ye?—
        </p>
